          Ever since I took up my course in Computer Science in UP Cebu
          (University of the Philippines), I was able to at least equip myself
          on some fundamentals in both low and high level programming languages.

          During my college years, I took up a part-time job in developing web
          applications for small to medium enterprises.

          web and mobile hybrid tech â€” React, React Native, HTML/CSS etc.
