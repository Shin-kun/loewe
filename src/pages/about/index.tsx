          I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of the
          Philippines, Cebu. During my college years, I was able to take on a
          part-time job in developing web applications for small to medium
          enterprises which further strengthened my skills.

          Since then, I am passionate, keen to details, innovative, & dependable
          when given a task/project. Fast forward to 2022, I've focused my
          expertise on various web & mobile technologies â€” React, React Native,
          HTML/CSS etc.

          part-time job in helping establish a startup company. I have since
          been its tech lead in the web & mobile frontend development.
